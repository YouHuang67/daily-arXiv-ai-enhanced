This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ContextASR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e868/12\u6307\u6807\u7684SOTA\u6210\u7ee9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u5f81\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668MingTok-Audio\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578bMing-UniAudio-Edit\u3002", "result": "\u5728ContextASR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d8/12\u6307\u6807\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff1b\u4e2d\u6587\u8bed\u97f3\u514b\u9686\u7684Seed-TTS-WER\u8fbe\u52300.95\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u97f3\u9891\u5904\u7406\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb(CIA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50LLMs\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d1\u6563\u524d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7247\u6bb5\u6765\u6545\u610f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50LLMs\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u5339\u914dSFT\u540c\u65f6\u524a\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u5e76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50LLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u9010\u5b57\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9010\u5b57\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5404\u79cdLLMs\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity. However, in multimodal scenarios, distributional biases across modality tokens and attentional biases in cross-modal interactions limit its effectiveness. This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones.

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08T-SAEs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u76f8\u90bbtoken\u95f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u504f\u5411\u6d45\u5c42\u3001token\u7279\u5b9a\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7b49\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6355\u83b7\u6d45\u5c42\u3001token\u7279\u5b9a\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u5177\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3001\u800c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u66f4\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51faT-SAEs\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u76f8\u90bbtoken\u95f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cT-SAEs\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u91cd\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "T-SAEs\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u53d1\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints.

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u951a\u70b9\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u6574\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bc1\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u8d21\u732e\u4ecd\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3LLM\u4e2d\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff1b(2)\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5b57\u6bb5\u7684\u7cbe\u786eShapley\u503c\u5f52\u56e0\uff1b(3)\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gemma-2B\u3001Phi-2\u548cLlama-2-7B\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u663e\u793a\u951a\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5982GPT-2\u3001Falcon-RW-1B\u548cGPT-Neo-125M\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u80fd\u8c03\u8282\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5f52\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u968f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c06LLM\u89c6\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4e2d\u5176\u4ed6\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once.

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability.

Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LEAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6267\u884c\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4\u7b49\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLEAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8c03\u4f18\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6267\u884c\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u3001\u5ba1\u67e5\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLEAP\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LEAP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply.

We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks.

As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities.

While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u5c31\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c42\u9762\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6d77\u91cf\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u6548\u76ca\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2\uff09\u4e2d\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u91cf\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u51fa\u73b0\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone.

However, the existence of such a guarantee does not speak to its practical feasibility. In this work, we show that even for simple and well-studied language families -- such as regular and context-free languages -- the number of examples required for successful generation can be extraordinarily large, and in some cases not bounded by any computable function. These results reveal a substantial gap between theoretical possibility and efficient learnability. They suggest that explaining the empirical success of modern language models requires a refined perspective -- one that takes into account structural properties of natural language that make effective generation possible in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u6781\u5176\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u754c\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136Kleinberg\u548cMullainathan\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u672a\u6d89\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u5219\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u6781\u5176\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u754c\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "DRAGON\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDRAGON\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684CoT\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DRAGON\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DRAGON\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4LLM\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning.

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNILC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u610f\u56fe\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea7\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b0\u610f\u56fe\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "NILC\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u521b\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u8d28\u5fc3\u4e30\u5bcc\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u5fc3\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5199\u589e\u5f3a\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u8f6f\u5fc5\u987b\u94fe\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNILC\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "NILC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65b0\u610f\u56fe\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eRL\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u5c42\u6b21\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5373\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RL\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7eaf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfcSFT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83RL\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u95f4\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "RL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u548cSFT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u5728MedConceptsQA\u4e0a\u4ece24pp\u964d\u81f37pp\uff09\uff0c\u4f46RL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8def\u5f84\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u4e3b\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u904d\u5386\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6280\u80fd\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56de\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations.

However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bftoken\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6b21\u4f18\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9RLVR\u4e2d\u71b5\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLMs\u7684\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u4f18\u52bftoken\u662f\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u8005\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bftoken\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u6b21\u6570\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u9608\u503c\u662f\u5f71\u54cdRLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLMs\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u6b63\u4f18\u52bftoken\u662f\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dLLMs\u7684\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u6765\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u6b63\u8d1f\u4f18\u52bftoken\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\u662f\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u71b5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time.

However, as language models are increasingly integrated into biomedical evidence synthesis workflows, it remains uncertain whether these systems preserve such crucial demographic distinctions. To address this gap, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art language models retain age-related information when generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations. We evaluate three prominent summarisation-capable LLMs, Qwen (open-source), Longformer (open-source) and GPT-4.1 Nano (proprietary), using both standard metrics and a newly proposed Demographic Salience Score (DSS), which quantifies age-related entity retention and hallucination. Our results reveal systematic disparities across models and age groups: demographic fidelity is lowest for adult-focused summaries, and under-represented populations are more prone to hallucinations. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in faithful and bias-free summarisation and point to the need for fairness-aware evaluation frameworks and summarisation pipelines in biomedical NLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6458\u8981\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6210\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5dee\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u5c1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDemogSummary\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u513f\u7ae5\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30Qwen\u3001Longformer\u548cGPT-4.1 Nano\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u548c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Demographic Salience Score\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u5b9e\u4f53\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e74\u9f84\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6210\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u6458\u8981\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fe0\u5b9e\u548c\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

While recent alignment techniques such as RLHF and DPO have mitigated some of these issues, they remain limited in addressing culturally specific and multi-dimensional forms of discrimination. This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness.

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters.

However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples.

ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \\textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion.

Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7247\u6bb5\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u751f\u6210\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6839\u636e\u7ed3\u679c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728DocMath-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match.

Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration.

Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not').

Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness.

To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines.

However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems. These re-sults highlight both the promise and remaining challenges of applying LLMs to medication recommendation in Chinese EHRs.

Through analysis, we identify that the model struggles with correctly classifying examples containing negation.

However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks. Moreover, we show that parameter-free early exiting with prototypes is effective for both hate types.

We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images.

We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction.

Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph.

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks.

Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\method}, a \\textbf{Math}ematical \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \\method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM).

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5TAQ\u548cTAQO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u6709\u9650\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TAQ\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u914d\u4f4d\u5bbd\uff09\u548cTAQO\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5c42\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u4ed6\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTAQ\u5728Phi-4\u4e0a\u9886\u5148\uff0cTAQO\u5728Llama-3.1\u3001Qwen3\u548cQwen2.5\u4e0a\u9886\u5148\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5728Phi-4\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523042.33 EM/50.81 F1\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85AWQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931<1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence.

More than 500 languages are spoken in Nigeria and it is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. Despite this, natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on the following four languages: Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba (i.e <1% of the languages spoken in Nigeria). This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200.

In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity.

By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it.

We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities.

Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design.

In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\\mathcal{EL}_\\bot$ and $\\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\\text{DL-Lite}^\\mathcal{H}_\\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\\mathsf{TC}_0$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u6743\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e0b\u754c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8EL\u22a5\u5230ALCO\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5305\u542b\u9006\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u5305\u542b\u7684DL-Lite\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u914d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdd\u53cd\u516c\u7406\u548c\u65ad\u8a00\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\uff08\u6216\u67d0\u4e9b\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u6709\u754c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8eDL-Lite^H_bool\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6210\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u8054\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u91cd\u5199\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6TC0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4e3aDL-Lite^H_bool\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions.

However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "TSAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u5e76\u7efc\u5408\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5224\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6743\u8861\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u56de\u7b54\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6216\u8bed\u6c14\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5404\u6709\u6240\u957f\u3002", "method": "TSAN\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u952e\u548c\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7efc\u5408\u5404\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7840SFT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4ec5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0cTSAN\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\u7b49\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TSAN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an H\u00e1jek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u578bLLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6CMM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LLM\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5c42\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7684LLM\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528H\u00e1jek-MoE\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684LLM\u84b8\u998f\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCMM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8367\u5149\u63a2\u9488\u7814\u7a76LLM\u7279\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u5c42\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026LLM\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7b80\u5355LLM\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4\uff09\u5f15\u5165H\u00e1jek-MoE\u5728\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e02\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCMM\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CMM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e8623\u4e2a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08270M\u52304B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u5b57\u7b26\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u53cd\u8f6c\uff09\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ecd\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76SLMs\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf23\u4e2aSLMs\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5b57\u7b26\u548c\u5355\u8bcd\u53cd\u8f6c\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u53d8\u6362\u572825%\u300150%\u300175%\u548c100%\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u6362\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u53cd\u8f6c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9608\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\"\u80fd\u529b\u8bc5\u5492\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\uff1aSLMs\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6c61\u67d3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6c61\u67d3\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!", "AI": {"tldr": "SafeNlidb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLLM\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u65e0\u610f\u6cc4\u9732\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u673a\u5bc6\u5185\u5bb9\u6216\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u6765\u7a83\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5f71\u54cdSQL\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u548cSQL\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u514b\u670dDPO\u7684\u591a\u504f\u597d\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7684SQL\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeNlidb\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length.

The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios.

However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions.

However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances.

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Most existing studies for inference-time defences focus on surface-level token matching and rely on external blocklists or filters, which add deployment complexity and may overlook semantically paraphrased leakage. In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters. Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding. Experiments on widely recognized benchmarks show that SCOPE mitigates copyright infringement without degrading general utility.

We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.\n  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.\n  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u5230\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86BLEU\u5206\u6570\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u82f1\u8bed\u5230\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8bc4\u5224-\u4fee\u6b63\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8bc4\u5224\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5c06\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5206\u4e3a\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u6b67\u4e49\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7531\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u5668\u5904\u7406\uff1aGPT-4o-mini\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u9700\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u6d88\u6b67\u7684\u6807\u9898\uff0cIndicTrans2\u91cd\u65b0\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7eaf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u968f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5bf9IndicTrans2\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u5904\u7406\u4e8628,928\u4e2a\u8de8\u56db\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u6bcf\u79cd\u8bed\u8a0017.1%\u7684\u6807\u9898\u3002\u5728\u4fee\u6b63\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed-\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6\u4e0aBLEU\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347+1.30\uff0842.00\u219243.30\uff09\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u96c6+0.70\uff0844.90\u219245.60\uff09\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed-\u5965\u91cc\u4e9a\u8bed\u8bc4\u4f30\u96c6+0.60\uff0841.00\u219241.60\uff09\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed-\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u6311\u6218\u96c6+0.10\uff0853.90\u219254.00\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u82f1\u8bed\u5230\u5370\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty.

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.\n  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.\n  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u82f1\u56fd\u3001\u8377\u5170\u548c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u76845,836\u6761\u8bed\u97f3\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\u7b497\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5bf9\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u7684\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u590d\u53d1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u975e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u590d\u6742\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9RADAR-MDD\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u548cPHQ-8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0eMDD\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cMDD\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e7\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\uff1b\u5728\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u53e5\u5b50\u8bcd\u6570\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u8bcd\u9891\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5728\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u8bcd\u6c47\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u5185\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While recent models show strong performance, their training data or methodologies are often not fully disclosed. We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging.

This study evaluates multiple approaches for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886.

Our approach achieves multimodal planning for long-horizon tasks through a novel training pipeline incorporating dynamic pretraining and reinforced alignment. Our core innovations consist of three key components: \\textbf{1) Unified Multimodal Generation Framework}: For understanding, We integrate semantic information with spatial features to provide comprehensive visual perception. For generation, we directly learn the joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis, enabling coordinated language-visual modeling through learnable cross-modal attention mechanisms. \\textbf{2) Dynamic Perception Pretraining}: We propose a bidirectional dynamic alignment strategy employing inverse dynamics tasks and forward dynamics tasks, effectively strengthening multimodal correlations within a unified feature space. \\textbf{3) Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning}: While conducting instruction-based fine-tuning in the unified generation space, we construct a reinforce loss to align the spatial logic between textual actions and generated images, enabling the model to acquire spatio-awared multimodal planning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "EVLP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u534f\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00-\u89c6\u89c9\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EVLP\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5177\u8eab\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u8a00-\u89c6\u89c9\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics.

In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops.

Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset.

However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model.

In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization.

In this work, we present EMODIS, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capacity to interpret ambiguous emoji expressions under minimal but contrastive textual contexts. Each instance in EMODIS comprises an ambiguous sentence containing an emoji, two distinct disambiguating contexts that lead to divergent interpretations, and a specific question that requires contextual reasoning.

To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists.

For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C).

While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations.

RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute.

Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6846\u67b6(CLFA)\uff0c\u5229\u7528CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b14\u8ff9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7b14\u8ff9\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5728\u7ebf\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7b14\u8ff9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCLFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728CLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u690d\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b14\u8ff9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u7b14\u8ff9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\u6700\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206AD\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u6d1e\u5bdf\u548c\u7b14\u8ff9\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "CLFA\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b14\u8ff9\u7684\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e66\u5199\u6a21\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \\textbf{\\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \\textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \\textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \\textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u91cf\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7c7bNTK\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NTK-Selector\u9009\u62e9\u76849000\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281000\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6837\u672c\uff0cLlama3-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen3-8B\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97+8.7\u548c+5.1\u5206\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u8fbe10.9\u500d\u548c5.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "NTK-Selector\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6765\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u8868\u660e\u5faa\u73af\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines.

We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks.

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1.

Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI.

However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively.

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "MONICA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\u8c04\u5a9a\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7b49\u5f85\u5b8c\u6574\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u540c\u610f\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u8c04\u5a9a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMONICA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8c04\u5a9a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u3002\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u8c04\u5a9a\u6f02\u79fb\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u5668\u5728\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MONICA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c42\u9762\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects. We believe this work can foster advances in robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality.

However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MENTOR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7f13\u89e3LLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u6362\u4f4d\u601d\u8003\u548c\u540e\u679c\u601d\u7ef4\u53cd\u601d\u4ef7\u503c\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u601d\u7ed3\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b3. \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6765\u5f3a\u5316\u89c4\u5219\u9075\u5faa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMENTOR\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86LLMs\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms.

However, these methods often lack spatial reasoning and struggle with occluded or invisible centerlines. Generative approaches, despite their potential, remain underexplored in this domain. We introduce LaneDiffusion, a novel generative paradigm for centerline graph learning. LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process.

Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively.

Although prior research has modelled gaze cues in visual scenes, a unified system is still needed for gaze understanding using both visual and language prompts. This paper introduces GazeVLM, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multi-task gaze understanding in images, addressing person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object identification. While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis, GazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these combined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the integration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation study on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance. We also introduce an object-level gaze detection metric for gaze object identification ($AP_{ob}$).

Despite notable advancements, current IVOD models exhibit notable performance declines when confronted with incomplete modality data, particularly if the dominant modality is missing. In this paper, we take a thorough investigation on modality incomplete IVOD problem from an architecture compatibility perspective. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Scarf Neck module for DETR variants, which introduces a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism to enable the IVOD detector to flexibly adapt to any single or double modalities during training and inference. When training Scarf-DETR, we design a pseudo modality dropout strategy to fully utilize the multi-modality information, making the detector compatible and robust to both working modes of single and double modalities. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the modality-incomplete IVOD task aimed at thoroughly assessing situations where the absent modality is either dominant or secondary.

Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI4VA-FG\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9VLM\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524dVLMs\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RARL)\uff0c\u5728Qwen2.5-VL\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6545\u4e8b\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u7ebf\u6761\u827a\u672f\u3001\u62df\u58f0\u8bcd\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u9762\u677f\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u6f2b\u753b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaAI4VA-FG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41VLMs\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT-S\u3001SFT-R)\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u7b49\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RARL)\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aGPT-4o\u3001Gemini-2.5\u3001Qwen2.5-VL\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u7f3a\u9677\u3002RL\u548cRARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Qwen2.5-VL\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u5c42\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6545\u4e8b\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f2b\u753b\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u662f\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7279\u522b\u662fRARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u5728\u6f2b\u753b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6539\u5584\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u82f1\u8bed\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u6216\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u3002\u5bf9\u9f50\u5de5\u5177\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u8bf4\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u5608\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u8a00\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u751a\u81f3\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7a77\u5c3d\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u667a\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset.

These approaches often over-rely on single, unreliable dynamic features, and are typically built on CNNs with limited receptive fields or Transformers with quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a new effective and scalable video mirror detection method, called MirrorMamba. Our approach leverages multiple cues to adapt to diverse conditions, incorporating perceived depth, correspondence and optical. We also introduce an innovative Mamba-based Multidirection Correspondence Extractor, which benefits from the global receptive field and linear complexity of the emerging Mamba spatial state model to effectively capture correspondence properties. Additionally, we design a Mamba-based layer-wise boundary enforcement decoder to resolve the unclear boundary caused by the blurred depth map.

Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTiS-TSL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u5207\u6362\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u89c6\u9891\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u89e3\u5256\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u5dee\u76d1\u7763\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u95ea\u70c1\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u524d\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u540e\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u79fb\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTiS-TSL\u5728TEPE\u548cEPE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u53472.11%\u548c4.54%\u3002", "conclusion": "TiS-TSL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u5207\u6362\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u3002"}}

Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

However, existing trait maps remain limited by the high cost and sparse geographic coverage of field-based measurements. Citizen science initiatives offer a largely untapped resource to overcome these limitations, with over 50 million geotagged plant photographs worldwide capturing valuable visual information on plant morphology and physiology. In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping.

The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \\textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks.

One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap.

However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships. These findings expose critical limitations in current debiasing approaches when applied to semantically bound contexts, underscoring the need to reassess prevailing bias mitigation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61-\u5c5e\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u89c1\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710%\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5f80\u5f80\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61-\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u89c1\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u8bb0\u89e3\u8026\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710%\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c5e\u6027-\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u57fa\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information.

Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large vision-language models (VLMs) introduces major energy and sustainability challenges. We compare three strategies for federated violence detection under realistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: zero-shot inference with pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning. Hierarchical category grouping (based on semantic similarity and class exclusion) boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on the UCF-Crime dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative simulation study of LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with explicit energy and CO2e quantification.

While numerous methods have been proposed to detect anomalous objects on the road, leveraging the vision-language space-which provides rich linguistic knowledge-remains an underexplored field. We hypothesize that incorporating these linguistic cues can be especially beneficial in the complex contexts found in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.\n  To this end, we present a novel approach that trains a Text-Driven OOD Segmentation model to learn a semantically diverse set of objects in the vision-language space. Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language model's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts located at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and utilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across both pixel-level and object-level evaluations.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision.

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7531\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5e7b\u89c9\u81ea\u4fe1\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e0d\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u9003\u907f\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u57fa\u672c\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6301\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u7531\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5373\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4f46\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5f00\u6e90\u53ca\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGPT-5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u57fa\u672c\u5931\u6548\u3002\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u81ea\u4fe1\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e0d\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u9003\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u7531\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples. Our results suggest that inference-time guidance offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94CLIP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea2\u5916\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728FLUX.1-dev\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u9002\u5e94\u7ea2\u5916\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5408\u6210\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94CLIP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6280\u672f\u5fae\u8c03FLUX.1-dev\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728KAIST\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u884c\u4eba\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u7ebf\u6837\u672c\uff0cFID\u5206\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8610%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e3a\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u7ea2\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5f25\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment.
